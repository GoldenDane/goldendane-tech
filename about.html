      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        GoldenDane Tech is a Danish artificial intelligence company founded at
        the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).  Our mission is to develop
        high‑impact, trustworthy AI solutions for hospitals, public health systems
        and industrial engineering partners.  By harnessing secure supercomputing
        infrastructure, we create custom diagnostic and industrial AI models
        tailored to each client’s data and workflows while adhering to the
        EU AI Act, GDPR and other relevant regulations.
      </p>

    <!-- Expertise -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        We specialise in end‑to‑end AI development across a range of domains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clinical AI&nbsp;</strong>– diagnostic imaging, laboratory result interpretation and early‑warning scores for sepsis, deterioration or re‑hospitalisation</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial AI&nbsp;</strong>– predictive maintenance, digital twins, condition monitoring and optimisation for energy, manufacturing and infrastructure</li>
        <li><strong>Research & innovation&nbsp;</strong>– bespoke AI prototypes and feasibility studies in collaboration with academic and industry partners</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Every model is built from scratch on anonymised or pseudonymised data
        supplied by our clients.  We do not resell generic products; instead
        we co‑develop solutions that integrate seamlessly into existing processes.
      </p>

    <!-- Differentiators -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trusted by design&nbsp;</strong>– our quality management system covers risk management, data governance, documentation, cybersecurity and post‑market monitoring to meet the EU AI Act’s high‑risk requirements</li>
        <li><strong>Supercomputer advantage&nbsp;</strong>– we operate from DTU and use its secure, high‑performance computing cluster, which accelerates development and reduces cost</li>
        <li><strong>Human‑centric approach&nbsp;</strong>– we design AI systems that keep human experts in the loop, communicate uncertainty clearly and respect domain workflows</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent pilot programmes&nbsp;</strong>– fixed‑scope pilots deliver a working prototype and evaluation report within months, with no long‑term commitment</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Data privacy & compliance -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Data Privacy & Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        We understand the sensitivity of health and industrial data.  All data
        is processed under strict European data‑protection rules.  We act as
        a data processor under a signed Data Processing Agreement (DPA); clients
        remain the data controller.  Our processes incorporate the EU AI Act’s
        requirements for high‑risk systems—risk‑mitigation, high‑quality data
        sets and human oversight:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}—and align with the GDPR
        and the forthcoming European Health Data Space.  Anonymisation,
        pseudonymisation, access controls and audit logs are enforced on all
        projects.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Values & Team -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <p>We are guided by four core principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> – deliver AI systems that are transparent, explainable and safe</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – work closely with clinicians, engineers and researchers to co‑design solutions</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation</strong> – push the boundaries of AI while respecting regulatory and ethical frameworks</li>
        <li><strong>Impact</strong> – focus on applications that improve patient outcomes, operational efficiency and sustainability</li>
      </ul>
