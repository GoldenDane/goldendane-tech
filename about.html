    <!-- Mission -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        GoldenDane Tech is a Danish AI company focused on building practical,
        trustworthy AI systems for organisations operating
        in complex, high-stakes environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work with teams that rely on expert judgment, manual review, or
        inspection-heavy workflows, helping them apply AI in a controlled,
        auditable, and human-centred way.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Expertise -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        We design and deliver narrowly scoped AI projects that support human
        decision-making rather than replace it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI-assisted inspection and review systems</li>
        <li>Risk, anomaly, and prioritisation models</li>
        <li>Predictive analytics for operational and engineering contexts</li>
        <li>Custom evaluation and modelling tools built on client data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each project is co-developed with domain experts and tailored to existing
        workflows, using data provided by the partner organisation.
      </p>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Focused pilot projects</strong> – engagements start with a
          fixed-scope pilot designed to validate value early and safely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Human-in-the-loop design</strong> – systems are built to support
          expert judgment, with clear interfaces and oversight.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No off-the-shelf products</strong> – every solution is developed
          specifically for the partner’s data and use case.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear ownership</strong> – partners retain control over their data
          and resulting models.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Data privacy & compliance -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Data, Security, and Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        We take data protection and system reliability seriously, particularly
        when working with sensitive or business-critical information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects are developed using anonymised or pseudonymised data wherever
        possible, under clear contractual agreements. Our approach emphasises
        auditability, documentation, and appropriate human oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where relevant, work can be carried out on secure, GDPR-compliant
        infrastructure, and all solutions are designed to align with applicable
        European regulatory requirements.
      </p>
