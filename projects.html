      <h2>AI Solutions for Health &amp; Industry – Built With You</h2>
      <p>
        We design, develop and deploy machine‑learning models tailored to your organisation’s
        specific challenges.  In healthcare we focus on diagnostics, clinical risk prediction
        and operational decision‑making.  In engineering we build predictive maintenance tools,
        digital twins and intelligent control systems.  Every solution is co‑designed with
        domain experts and tested using real, anonymised data.

      <h2>What We Can Build</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diagnostic Support Models</strong> – AI models that assist with imaging interpretation, lab result analysis and early‑stage disease detection</li>
        <li><strong>Readmission &amp; Deterioration Prediction</strong> – Flag patients at risk of re‑hospitalisation or clinical decline to enable proactive care</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency &amp; ICU Resource Optimisation</strong> – Smart triage and forecasting tools to prioritise high‑risk patients and anticipate staffing, bed or ventilator needs</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Forecasting</strong> – Predict capacity needs such as bed usage, staffing levels or admissions by day and department</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Maintenance</strong> – Models that forecast equipment failures and maintenance needs in energy, manufacturing or infrastructure contexts</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Twins &amp; Condition Monitoring</strong> – Real‑time simulations of complex systems for optimisation and anomaly detection</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligent Control &amp; Optimisation</strong> – Agentic AI systems that adaptively control processes while keeping human operators in the loop</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Built on Your Data, Powered by DTU</h2>
      <p>
        All models are developed using anonymised or pseudonymised data provided by your
        organisation.  Development takes place on DTU’s secure, GDPR‑compliant computing
        infrastructure, and the resulting models remain fully under your control.  Our quality
        management system ensures that risk management, data governance and human oversight are
        built in from day one.
