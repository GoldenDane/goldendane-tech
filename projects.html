      <h2>Focused AI Projects for Inspection, Review, and Decision Support</h2>
      <p>
        GoldenDane Tech works on applied AI projects where human experts currently spend
        significant time on manual review, interpretation, or judgment-heavy analysis.
        Our projects focus on assisting—not replacing—domain specialists by improving
        speed, consistency, and prioritisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are representative project areas. Each engagement starts with a narrowly
        scoped pilot designed to validate value with real data.

      <h2>What We Can Build</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Inspection & Review Automation</strong> – AI-assisted analysis of images,
          sensor data, or inspection outputs to reduce manual review time and improve consistency
          (e.g. pipeline inspection data, equipment scans, quality checks).
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Risk & Anomaly Prioritisation</strong> – Models that flag high-risk cases,
          assets, or conditions so experts can focus attention where it matters most.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Decision Support for Clinical & Operational Teams</strong> – Assistive
          models that support—but do not automate—clinical or operational decisions using
          historical data and transparent logic.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Predictive Maintenance & Condition Monitoring</strong> – Forecasting and
          anomaly detection systems for industrial equipment and infrastructure.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Performance-Critical Evaluation Systems</strong> – Fast, custom evaluation
          engines for complex rule-based or simulation-driven environments.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Data Ownership, Security, and Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        Projects are developed using anonymised or pseudonymised data provided by the partner
        organisation. Systems are designed with auditability, human oversight, and data
        governance in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where relevant, development can be carried out on secure, GDPR-compliant infrastructure,
        and resulting models remain under the partner’s control.
