    <h2>AI Solutions for Hospitals — Built with You</h2>
    <p>
      We build machine learning models tailored to hospitals — with a special focus on
      diagnostics, clinical risk prediction, and operational decision-making.
      Each solution is co-designed with medical teams and tested using real, anonymized data.

    <h2>What We Can Build for You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Diagnostic Support Models</strong> — AI models trained to support imaging, lab result interpretation, or early-stage disease detection, based on your own data.</li>
      <li><strong>Readmission Prediction</strong> — Flag patients at risk of re-hospitalization after discharge.</li>
      <li><strong>Emergency Triage Optimization</strong> — Prioritize high-risk patients and reduce wait times through smart triage tools.</li>
      <li><strong>ICU & Surgical Resource Forecasting</strong> — Anticipate staffing, bed, or ventilator needs in intensive care or surgical wards.</li>
      <li><strong>Early Deterioration Detection</strong> — Predict which inpatients are at risk of clinical decline and intervene earlier.</li>
      <li><strong>Operational Forecasting</strong> — Predict capacity needs like bed usage, staffing levels, or admissions by day and department.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Built on Your Data, Hosted at DTU</h2>
    <p>
      All models are developed using anonymized or pseudonymized data provided by your hospital.
      Development takes place securely on DTU's GDPR-compliant infrastructure, and the results
      remain fully under your control.
