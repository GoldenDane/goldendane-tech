      <p>
      Soheil Ghoreishi works at the intersection of machine learning, computational modelling, and real-world decision-making. He develops software systems that operate reliably where data is imperfect, decisions carry risk, and human expertise remains essential.
      </p>

      <p>
      He specialises in turning complex, judgment-heavy processes, such as medical diagnostics and industrial inspection, into systems that are measurable, auditable, and deployable.
      <p>

      In addition to guiding technical strategy, Soheil works hands-on with model development, pilot design, and deployment planning, collaborating directly with clinicians, engineers, and technical decision-makers. He pays close attention to failure modes, edge cases, and operational constraints that determine real-world success.
      </p>

      <p>
      He is affiliated with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and studies regulatory, ethical, and organisational implications of deploying AI in healthcare and industry.

      </p>

      <p>
      Soheil is available for technical discussions, pilot planning, and early-stage collaborations.
