      <p>
      Soheil Ghoreishi works at the intersection of advanced machine learning, computational modelling, and real-world decision-making. He builds software systems that operate reliably in environments where data is imperfect, decisions carry risk, and human expertise cannot be removed from the loop.
      </p>

      <p>
      He specialises in turning complex, judgment-heavy processes—such as medical diagnostics and industrial inspection—into systems that are measurable, auditable, and deployable. His work emphasises robustness, interpretability, and practical validation over purely theoretical performance.
      </p>

      <p>
      In addition to guiding technical strategy, Soheil works hands-on with model development, pilot design, and deployment planning, collaborating directly with clinicians, engineers, and technical decision-makers. He pays close attention to failure modes, edge cases, and operational constraints that determine real-world success.
      </p>

      <p>
      He is affiliated with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and maintains an active interest in the regulatory, ethical, and organisational implications of deploying AI in healthcare and industrial contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
      Soheil can be contacted directly regarding technical discussions, pilot scoping, and early-stage collaborations.
